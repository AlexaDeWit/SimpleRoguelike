SimpleRoguelike
===============

A personal project and challenge, to build a roguelike, its engine, and its content generation tools using C#.

This is probably the most challenging project I've given myself to date, at around the same difficulty as my first semester GML chess game, except that this uses many more conepts that I'm teaching myself while developing.

I welcome contributions from interested parties, as it will help me learn how to program in a group setting, which is another of the things I wish to teach myself over the course of this and subsequent projects.

The diagrams in the Diagrams folder can be opened by yEd, a free graphing software, and show early representations of some class hierarchies. Many things have changed in design terms, but I've tried to keep the inheritences easy to infer and generally just intuive.
